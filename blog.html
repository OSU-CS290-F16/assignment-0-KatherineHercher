      <h3>Assignment 1 - 9/25/16 </h3>
      <p>The only issues I had with the assignment was learning to use Git and Github as I had not previously used them. After doing the tutorials and learning from classmates what I didn't know, I was able to do the assignment with very few issues. Coming in I already knew the basic structure of an HTML page, so the formatting with lists and headings wasn't too hard after the in class refresher on Friday. I have found myself already using Piazza to see what other questions classmates had about using Github. I also used Codeacademy to input my HTML code and check if I had formatted my page how I wanted to. The internet is a great resource for coding!</p>
